2. Define your Rake tasks in a Rakefile.
3. Use the Sublayer framework's built-in generators and actions to automate testing processes.

**Usage:**
To run your tests using Rake, navigate to your applicationâ€™s root directory and execute:

```shell
rake test
```

For more detailed instructions and examples, refer to the [Quick Start](/docs/quick_start.md) guide and the [Step-by-Step Integration](/docs/guides/ruby-rake-integration.md) tutorial.

## Choose Your AI Model

Reflecting the latest updates, select from a variety of AI models that best suit your application's needs. Visit the documentation to understand the configurations and capabilities of each model. Make sure your API keys (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`) are set up correctly in your environment.

For assistance in configuring these models, refer to the [Advanced Config](/docs/advanced_config.md) section.
