## New Feature: Sublayer Agent Generation

We are excited to introduce the Sublayer Agent generation functionality in our latest update. This allows you to create autonomous agents that can monitor, act, and achieve goals within your projects. You can use AI providers like OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini for these agents.

### Key Highlights
- Generate agents with custom triggers, goals, status checks, and step actions.
- Leverage AI models such as GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini for more tailored and efficient outcomes.

### Example Use Cases
- **Automated Coding Assistance**: Automatically generate code to meet test criteria
- **Content Monitoring**: Track changes in files and update relevant sections
- **System Analysis**: Continuously check system status and make necessary updates
